= DEC Bus Transceiver Ideas

Experiments in looking for a circuit that could perform the function
of a bus transceiver for the DEC busses (Unibus and QBUS).

For the moment, this is a place to jot down ideas but if it were to be
carried through, the idea would be to build a small test board to try
out the transceiver circuit on real busses to see that it works.
